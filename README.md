### Introduction
Next Word Prediction is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) where the goal is to predict the most likely next word given a sequence of words. This repository demonstrates how to implement such a model using LSTM networks, which are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.

### Features
- Implementation of an LSTM-based next word prediction model.
- Uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model.
- Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and visualization of the steps.
- Includes preprocessing steps for text data.
  
### Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

Clone the repository by using the command
```
git clone https: https://github.com/tanishavyass22/tanishavyass22-Next-word-prediction-using-Lstm
```
Install dependencies by running the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook next word prediction model using LSTM.ipynb. You can run the notebook step by step to understand and execute the code for training and evaluating the next word prediction model.

##### Running the Notebook
To run the Jupyter Notebook run the following command
```
jupyter notebook "next word prediction model using LSTM.ipynb"
```
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, build, train, and evaluate the model.

##### Training
The Jupyter Notebook includes the complete workflow for training the LSTM model. This involves:

- Loading and preprocessing the text data.
- Building the LSTM model using Keras.
- Training the model on the prepared dataset.
You can customize the hyperparameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and the architecture of the LSTM network within the notebook.

##### Evaluation
The evaluation steps are included in the Jupyter Notebook. These steps involve generating predictions using the trained model and evaluating its performance based on various metrics.

##### Results
The results of the model, including the accuracy and examples of next word predictions, will be displayed in the notebook after running the evaluation cells.
